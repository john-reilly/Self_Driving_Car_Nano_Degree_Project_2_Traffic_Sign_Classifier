# If you want to run the code please refer to the links below


The program is in [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) running in a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)


You can use the below conda environment to make sure all dependencies etc are present.

__**Please note my repo is on its own is not enough to run the program as shown. You will need the "German Traffic Sign Data Set"  which is about 40,000 individual images of road signs. See Udacitys default README file below for links and instructions**__ 


Clone the Udacity project repo below, download my notebook and run in the same folder 


Udacity default [readme file]( https://github.com/john-reilly/Self_Driving_Car_Nano_Degree_Project_2_Traffic_Sign_Classifier/blob/master/Udacitys_README.md), provides an overview and many links including to the German Traffic Sign Data Set

Udacity Project [repo](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project), students begin by cloning this repo and that gives them the images etc to get started.

Udacity provided [code](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb), this is a link to the page in the project repo that contains the basic code that is built upon by the student. 

Udacity environment [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md), a conda environment to ensure the code runs correctly 

Udacity suggested [writeup template](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/writeup_template.md), a suggestion for how the notebook should be presented

Udacity [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/481/view), to explain how it is graded.
